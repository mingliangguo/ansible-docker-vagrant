# README

A simple vagrant box with python and docker installed to showcase how to run end-2-end test using [testcontainers-python](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-python)

The sample python code is located in the `code` folder and can be found in the `/vagrant/code` folder inside the box.

## How to Use

Get inside the vagrant box after startup and you have full access to a ubuntu environment with python and docker installed.

```bash
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
```
